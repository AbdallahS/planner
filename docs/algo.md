# Algorithm

1. Place unplaced courses in a priority queue
2. Going through the plan term by term until all courses are placed, place courses in the term if their requirements can satisfied
3. Use iterative deepening to increase max plan length (necessary?)
4. Try swaping n courses with each other, with iterative max swap size limit n (necessary?)
